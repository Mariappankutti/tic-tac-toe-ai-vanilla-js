# Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe game build in vanilla javascript, along with some nice HTML & CSS.
There are 2 implementations of this tic tac toe game one is the simple one in which both the user & the bot can win. The other is an implementation where the bot always wins or it ties. But never looses. 

<hr />

To use the `simpleAi.js` implementation simply go in the `index.html` file and  at the very bottom in the `script tag` uncomment the line with `smartAi.js`. If you want to use the the one with the minimax algorithm do the opposite.

```diff
- <script src="smartAi.js"></script>
+ <script src="simpleAi.js"></script>
```

### How To Use It
* Clone the repository
* Go in `index.html` file 
* If you want to use simple 2 player (You & Dumb Bot) uncomment the script with `simpleAi.js`
* If you want to use 2 player (You & Undefeated Bot) uncomment the script with `smartAi.js`
